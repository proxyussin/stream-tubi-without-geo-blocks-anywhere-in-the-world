This blog will explain why Tubi imposes such limitations and how you can access Tubi freely from any location using a proxy.

## Why Tubi Restricts Content Based on Region

Like many streaming platforms, Tubiâ€™s content availability varies depending on licensing agreements and regional broadcast rights. Some movies and shows are licensed only for certain countries or regions, compelling Tubi to geo-block users outside these areas.

If you attempt to watch Tubi from a restricted location, you may face error messages or be denied access altogether. These geo-restrictions prevent global audiences from enjoying Tubiâ€™s full catalog.

## How a Proxy Helps You Access Tubi Freely

To bypass Tubiâ€™s geographic restrictions, a proxy server can be used to route your internet traffic through a permitted region, usually the US or Canada. This masks your real IP address, making it appear as if youâ€™re browsing from an allowed location. As a result, you gain full access to Tubiâ€™s entire content library without interruptions.

Residential proxies are especially beneficial in this case, as they provide real IPs linked to actual users, reducing the chance of detection and blocking compared to datacenter proxies. This ensures a smoother and more reliable streaming experience on Tubi.

## Choosing the Right Proxy to Unlock Tubi

When selecting a proxy to access Tubi, prioritize fast and stable connections to avoid buffering or streaming disruptions. Itâ€™s important to have access to a wide range of IP addresses in the regions where Tubi is officially available. This variety helps prevent IP bans and ensures uninterrupted viewing.

Additionally, proxies located close to Tubiâ€™s servers help reduce latency and improve video quality. Providers like [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com?utm_source=web20&utm_id=SEOjonni123) offer premium residential proxies designed to deliver optimal streaming performance for platforms like Tubi.
